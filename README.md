# FirstPersonFunk

A mod for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk that adds a first person camera that works on every character.

## Settings

### `ShowPlayer`

Whether to show the player in first person mode. When disabled, your torso and headgear is hidden from view, making it easier to see.

### `RotateWithHead`

When enabled, makes the camera rotate with the head bone on the character. It will swerve and bob around as the player moves.
